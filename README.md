The main task of this small program is to work with ACR Cloud.
Recording only via Realtek Mix or media files, Russian and English OS are supported(Or maybe any languages, I haven't checked).

— Starting from version 1.5.0, no actions need to be performed with the stereo mixer, recording is performed directly from the default playback device.

> if you run "py" files, you will need ffmpeg https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
